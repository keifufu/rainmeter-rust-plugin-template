## Rainmeter Rust Plugin Template
A template for rainmeter plugins written in rust.  
The example given is a simple counter, check Example.ini

### Why?
Rust is cool

### Building
Install rust, clone this repo and run `build.bat`

### Notes
- build.bat assumes you have rainmeter installed in C:\Program Files\Rainmeter
- If you change the name in Cargo.toml, update the filename in build.bat
- Probably doesn't work for 32-bit as is

### TODO
- Add copyright and version metadata to dll
